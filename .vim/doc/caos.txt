*caos.txt*	Filetype-Plugin, Syntax-Highlighting, Indentation for CAOS

This is a suite of vim-scripts, which introduce syntax-highlighting,
indentation and some functions for the CAOS scripting language to Vim.

Currently, there are several functions, which allow you to interact with
a running Dockinstation/Creatures3-Game. 

Injecting CAOS code and agents into the game	*inject* *chooseinject*

There are two main functions to inject code into the running game:
(Note: Remember, that you have to install netcat for this to work!)

Inject:
    This function injects the whole buffer. A remove script is recognized
    and left out. By default it is mapped to '<F11>'.

ChooseInject:
    With this function one can inject single CAOS commands. The command,
    which should be injected, is asked from the user interactively. By
    default it is mapped to '\c'

Removing agents from the game.			*uninject*

    With the UnInject function, you can "uninject" a script, ie. inject
    the remove script of the current buffer. It's mapped to '<F12>' by
    default.

Settings:					*caos-settings*

						*caosusegui*
    Set "CaosUseGui" to 1 in order to use gui-dialogs, when running gvim.
    When running in console, this option has no effect.

						*caosusewinstd*
    Set "CaosUseWinStd" to 0, if you don't want to use the
    standard keys of the CAOS-Tool from Creature Labs.

						*caosindent*
    Set "CaosIndent" to the number of columns, you want the indent
    to be increased for each doif, loop, etc. It may be any integer
    value, other variable or Vim option, eg. &ts for the value of
    tabstop. Default: &sw (= shiftwidth)

Key mappings:					*caos-keymappings*

    CaosUseWinStd == 1:
	<F11>		inject current buffer
	<F12>		inject remove script of current buffer
	\c		inject a given command
	\m		get help about word under cursor
			(If there is no word, the user is asked for one.)
	\a		list all command names, which help contains the
			given text.
    
    CaosUseWinStd == 0:
	\i		inject current buffer
	\u		inject remove script of current buffer
    The other maps are the same as above.

    Note: The '\' is the default value of localmapleader. Please,
    refer to the Vim-Help for changing this.

Example: (part of my .vimrc)			*caos-rc-example*

    augroup caos
	au!

	let CaosUseGui = 0
	let CaosWinStd = 0
    augroup END
